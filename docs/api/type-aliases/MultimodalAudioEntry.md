[NeuroLink API Reference](../README.md) / MultimodalAudioEntry

# Type Alias: MultimodalAudioEntry

> **MultimodalAudioEntry** = `object`

Defined in: [types/file.ts:66](https://github.com/juspay/neurolink/blob/release/src/lib/types/file.ts#L66)

One audio file destined for native delivery to a provider.

Carries the bytes rather than a path because the decision to send audio is
made per provider, after detection has already read the file — re-reading it
from disk at dispatch time would be a second read of something already in
memory.
