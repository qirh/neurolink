/**
 * Continuous Test Suite: Office document processing (OFFICE-003 / OFFICE-005).
 *
 * Every test drives the public surface — `NeuroLink.generate()` / `stream()`
 * with a `.docx` or `.xlsx` attached — and asserts on the body NeuroLink
 * actually sent upstream, captured by a loopback mock chat server. That makes
 * each assertion a statement about what the model receives, which is the only
 * thing a caller can observe, and needs no credentials and no network.
 *
 * WHY THE OUTBOUND BODY AND NOT THE REPLY. Office files are delivered as text
 * injected into the prompt before the provider is chosen, so the extraction is
 * provider-independent by construction and a live model's paraphrase would be
 * a weaker signal than the bytes on the wire. The one genuinely live
 * round-trip — an ordinary .docx answered by a real provider — is already
 * covered in `continuous-test-suite-office-security.ts` and is not duplicated.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx test/continuous-test-suite-office.ts
