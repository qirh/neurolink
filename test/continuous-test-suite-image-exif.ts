/**
 * Continuous Test Suite: EXIF orientation normalization for image intake.
 *
 * Issue #561 — a JPEG stored with `Orientation=6` (the common case for a
 * phone photo: the sensor is read in one fixed orientation and the rotation
 * the camera was held at is recorded as a tag, not baked into the pixels)
 * used to be sent to the provider exactly as stored, so the model saw it
 * rotated 90°. Universal formats (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP) skipped the transcode
 * path entirely (`needsVisionTranscode()` is false for all four), so nothing
 * in the intake pipeline ever looked at the tag.
 *
 * The fix adds an orientation-normalization pass — `normalizeImageOrientation`
 * in `src/lib/adapters/imageFormatSupport.ts`, wired into both
 * `processImageToBase64` and `normalizeVisionImageFormats` in
 * `src/lib/utils/messageBuilder.ts` — that runs for every image a caller
 * supplies, not only ones that happen to need transcoding. It uses sharp's
 * `.rotate()` with no arguments, which auto-orients from the EXIF tag and
 * strips it from the output.
 *
 * This suite proves that end-to-end: a mock chat server captures the exact
 * outbound request body `generate()` would have sent to OpenAI, so the
 * assertion is about what actually left the process, not about what a live
 * model reports back.
 *
 * Three costs are exercised directly:
 *  - **Cost** — the second case proves an image that carries no correction
 *    (orientation 1, or no tag at all) is sent byte-identical, i.e. the fix
 *    does not re-encode every image unconditionally.
 *  - **Availability** — covered by design, not by this suite: sharp is
 *    already a hard dependency of this test file (it builds the fixture), so
 *    a suite cannot exercise "sharp is absent" without uninstalling it from
 *    under itself. `normalizeImageOrientation`'s try/catch degrading to the
 *    original bytes is reviewable directly in `imageFormatSupport.ts`.
 *  - **Size** — the size guard re-applies after orientation normalization in
 *    both call sites (see `ImageProcessor.validateBufferSize` /
 *    `withinConversionLimit` calls immediately following each
 *    `normalizeImageOrientation` call in `messageBuilder.ts`); not
 *    separately exercised here because forcing the *re-encoded* buffer over
 *    the limit while the *original* stays under it needs a pathological
 *    fixture with no proportional relationship to what this suite already
 *    builds, and the guard is the same one every other image path already
 *    relies on (`imageProcessor.ts`), not new logic this fix introduces.
 *
 * ## What the later cases cover, and one thing they cannot
 *
 * Review of the first cut raised two performance findings, and the cases
 * below are split along the line of what is observable from out here.
 *
 * **Fusing the double encode IS observable.** A format that both carries an
 * orientation tag and needs a vision transcode (TIFF, HEIC, HEIF, AVIF) was
 * being oriented in one full decode/re-encode and transcoded in a second.
 * That is not merely slower: sharp writes TIFF JPEG-compressed by default, so
 * the intermediate re-encode spent a generation of image quality, and the
 * model then read the worse copy. Fusing both into one `sharp().rotate()
 * .png()` pipeline removes the intermediate entirely, and the outbound bytes
 * say so — the "single-pass" cases assert the image that left the process is
 * pixel-identical to one decode and one encode of the source. They fail on
 * the two-pass tree, which is the point.
 *
 * **Skipping the disk read is NOT observable.** Answering "does this JPEG
 * carry an orientation tag?" from a bounded header prefix instead of reading
 * the whole file produces, by construction, byte-identical output — that is
 * the entire claim. Nothing a caller can reach reports bytes read, and a
 * timing or memory threshold would be a flake, not a gate. So the local-file
 * cases below are regression guards on the outcome, not proof of the saving:
 * a tag inside the window is still honoured, a tag pushed past the window is
 * still honoured, and a file with no tag arrives byte-identical. The saving
 * itself is only reviewable in `probeFileExifOrientation`.
 *
 * Two of those guards were measured rather than assumed, and one came back
 * weaker than it looks. Rebuilding with `probeJpegOrientation` deliberately
 * returning `"absent"` on prefix exhaustion — the exact bug the past-the-
 * window case is written against — leaves all eight cases green. The reason
 * is that on that provider path a wrong "absent" only skips
 * `normalizeVisionImageFormats`; `processImageToBase64` then re-probes the
 * whole buffer, where the walk cannot run out, and orients the image anyway.
 * So that case gates the end-to-end behaviour, which is what a caller
 * experiences, but it does **not** gate the file probe's fallback on its own.
 *
 * The last two cases do. AI Studio's and Vertex's native paths each call
 * `normalizeVisionImageFormats` themselves and then read `input.images`
 * directly, with no second probe behind them, so there the verdict is the
 * only vote. Same fixture, same claim — and under that injected bug they are
 * the only two cases that go red, which is what says the coverage is real
 * rather than incidental.
 *

/**
 * Send a JPEG whose orientation tag sits past the probe's window through one
 * native provider path, and assert the image that left was upright.
 *
 * These are the only places the header probe's verdict is the sole vote. Both
 * providers call `normalizeVisionImageFormats` themselves and then read
 * `input.images` directly — AI Studio via `buildUserPartsWithMultimodal`,
 * Vertex in its own loop — and each `readFileSync`s a path straight into an
 * `inlineData` part. Nothing behind them re-probes the way
 * `processImageToBase64` does on the OpenAI path, so unlike the
 * past-the-window case above, these fail when the probe treats prefix
 * exhaustion as "no tag". Verified by rebuilding with exactly that bug
 * injected: these two went red and all eight others stayed green.
