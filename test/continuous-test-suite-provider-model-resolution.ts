/**
 * Continuous Test Suite: provider and model name resolution (#354, #337),
 * driven through the public surface (Rule 15).
 *
 * Both issues are about what happens to a *name* on the way into
 * `ProviderFactory.createProvider`, so both are reached the same way — through
 * `new NeuroLink().generate()` — and neither needs a real credential:
 *
 *   - #354 rejects before any network call, so the provider cases just read
 *     the rejection message.
 *   - #337 has to observe the model id that actually reaches the wire, so the
 *     model cases run under `installMockFetch` with a fake OPENAI_API_KEY (the
 *     idiom from continuous-test-suite-file-intake-validation.ts) and assert on
 *     the captured request body.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx test/continuous-test-suite-provider-model-resolution.ts
