/**
 * Continuous Test Suite: video keyframe timestamps and audio transcription.
 *
 * Covers VIDEO-011 (#433) and VIDEO-018 (#460).
 *
 * ## What these assertions are really guarding
 *
 * Every knob under `videoOptions` was unreachable. `NeuroLink.generate()`
 * rebuilt its options into `TextGenerationOptions` and carried `csvOptions`
 * and `pdfOptions` across but not `videoOptions`, and two more
 * reconstructions downstream dropped it the same way. So `--video-frames 2`
 * on a four-second clip produced the tier default of four frames, and
 * `--transcribe-audio` reached no code that could act on it. The plumbing at
 * the far end had been correct since #478; nothing ever arrived.
 *
 * That failure is invisible from a passing generation — the model answers
 * either way — which is why the frame-count assertion below reads the actual
 * number extracted rather than whether the request succeeded.
 *
 * ## The fixture
 *
 * `test/fixtures/media/sample-clip.mp4` — 3.6s, 160x120, H.264 + AAC, three
 * solid colour segments (red, blue, green) and a voice saying "the secret
 * word is flamingo". OpenAI is used throughout precisely because it is on
 * the frame-extraction path: it cannot hear the clip, so the spoken word is
 * a clean probe for whether a transcript was produced and attached.
 *
 * Frame extraction needs ffmpeg, so most of this suite skips without it.
 * That is the right behaviour rather than a gap — ffmpeg is deliberately
 * absent in CI, and native delivery (the path that needs none) is covered by
 * continuous-test-suite-video-native.ts.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx test/continuous-test-suite-video-frames.ts
