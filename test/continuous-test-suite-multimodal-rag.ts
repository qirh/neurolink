/**
 * Continuous Test Suite — multi-modal embeddings and RAG image ingestion.
 *
 * Covers the surface added by the multi-modal embedding work: the widened
 * `embed()` signature across the provider clients, Nova's per-request modality
 * rules, and the caption an ingested image carries into the vector store.
 *
 * Everything drives shipped entry points — `AIProviderFactory` from
 * `../dist/index.js` and `ImageLoader` from the `./rag` subpath's
 * `../dist/rag/index.js` — with nothing stubbed and no imports out of `src/`,
 * so no rule-15 exception is needed. The provider cases run on deliberately
 * fake AWS credentials because every rejection they assert happens while the
 * request body is being built, before anything is sent; a case that reached the
 * network would fail here rather than pass quietly, which is the point.
 *
 * NOT covered, deliberately, and worth knowing before adding to this file: the
 * `loadFromURL` branch of `ImageLoader`. Its redaction is the same helper the
 * path branch uses, but the branch itself cannot be reached offline — the SSRF
 * guard in `safeFetch` permits only HTTPS and refuses to resolve a private
 * address, so a local stand-in is rejected before any redaction runs. That is a
 * security property working correctly, not a gap to route around, and defeating
 * it for a test would be a worse trade than leaving the branch to the shared
 * helper that case 4 pins.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx test/continuous-test-suite-multimodal-rag.ts
