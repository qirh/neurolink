/**
 * Continuous Test Suite: native video delivery.
 *
 * Covers VIDEO-007 (#421), VIDEO-013 (#439), VIDEO-014 (#444) and
 * VIDEO-019 (#463).
 *
 * ## Why this is not folded into continuous-test-suite-multimodal-sdk.ts
 *
 * Two reasons, and both matter.
 *
 * First, that suite builds its clip with `makeVideoFile`, which shells out to
 * ffmpeg and skips the whole group when ffmpeg is absent. Native delivery
 * exists precisely for the case where ffmpeg is absent — no binary, no
 * keyframes, and the video itself is the only visual content in the request —
 * so a suite that cannot run without ffmpeg cannot test it. Everything here
 * uses a committed 14 KB fixture instead and runs anywhere.
 *
 * Second, that suite's video assertions ask the model for the clip's pixel
 * resolution. That question is answered by the metadata summary
 * (`1920x1080 | avc | 30 fps`) that detection folds into the prompt text, so
 * it passes with zero frames and zero video attached — the exact trap
 * `adapters/audioFormatSupport.ts` documents for audio. The assertions here
 * are built the other way round: the fixture carries a spoken word, and
 * nothing in the metadata block or in a JPEG keyframe can convey it.
 *
 * ## The fixture
 *
 * `test/fixtures/media/sample-clip.mp4` — 3.6s, 160x120, H.264 + AAC. Three
 * solid colour segments (red, blue, green) and a voice saying "the secret
 * word is flamingo". The colours are readable from keyframes; the word is
 * readable only from the video's audio track. Asking for both in one prompt
 * makes a partial answer diagnostic rather than ambiguous.
 *
 * Live tests SKIP without credentials.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx test/continuous-test-suite-video-native.ts
